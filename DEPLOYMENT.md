### To deploy the contracts just use the code for all the contracts on the [Remix](http://remix.ethereum.org/) platform

1. Use the following files under **/contract** and compile them on Remix

2. Once you compile, you will be able to see the list as below

3. After the contracts have succesfully compiled, we can go ahead and deploy it using the run section as we can see the contracts loaded up there.
4. I used metamask and Rinkeby test network to deploy and test my contracts out and buy my custom ERC20 Tokens with test network Ether.
